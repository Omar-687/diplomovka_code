This repository is designed for implementing algorithms which solve ev charging optimisation problem. To make our algorithms reusable and adaptable to real life charging we implement our algorithms using acnportal simulator. Input data for our algorithms about ev arrivals are from Caltech/JPL/Office1 charging stations. We compare our algorithms to algorithms implemented in repositories adacharge and acnportal.

We implemented those algorithms:
1. Smoothed Least Laxity First
