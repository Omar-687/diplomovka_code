    "In this lesson we will learn how to develop a custom algorithm and run it using ACN-Sim. For this example we will be writing an Earliest Deadline First Algorithm. This algorithm is already available as part of the SortingAlgorithm in the algorithms package, so we will compare the results of our implementation with the included one."

    "All custom algorithms should inherit from the abstract class BaseAlgorithm. It is the responsibility of all derived classes to implement the schedule method. This method takes as an input a list of EVs which are currently connected to the system but have not yet finished charging. Its output is a dictionary which maps a station_id to a list of charging rates. Each charging rate is valid for one period measured relative to the current period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example: \n",
    " * schedule[‘abc’][0] is the charging rate for station ‘abc’ during the current period \n",
    " * schedule[‘abc’][1] is the charging rate for the next period \n",
    " * and so on. \n",
    " \n",
    "If an algorithm only produces charging rates for the current time period, the length of each list should be 1. If this is the case, make sure to also set the maximum resolve period to be 1 period so that the algorithm will be called each period. An alternative is to repeat the charging rate a number of times equal to the max recompute period.\n",

    "As mentioned previously our new algorithm should inherit from BaseAlgorithm or a subclass of it."
